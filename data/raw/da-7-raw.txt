The main management objectives are coordinating the schedules of a large team, adequately delegating work so that all members can participate, and delivering high quality deliverables on time. To this end, three sub-teams have been made, each with the ability to meet and work independently under the project leader’s supervision.
Perform code reviews of critical software and algorithms.  Testing Android’s reliability and construction.  Expert engineers to support and backup the system’s hardware.
Careful and constant review of the features being implemented.  Evaluation of all features and their cost/benefit for the HOPE software.  Be flexible if change is needed. 
Be careful of "scope creep" which are uncontrolled changes.  Most large projects fall victim to scope creep. Scope creep often results in cost overrun.
